When you want to create an object that you only
want to initialize if you use it, that is, you are unsure whether you will use it
immediately or ever, you use something called lazy initialization, the syntax looks liks this.

Normal Object Creation
val objectName = ClassName(parameters)

Lazy Creation
val ObjectName by lazy {
 ClassName(parameters)
}

The 'init' code block of the Class will only be executed when the object is used, otherwise
it will not be executed, hence it will save some time, and in programming that means
that creating lazy objects are less costly (time efficient) than creating normal objects which
are initialized when created.
